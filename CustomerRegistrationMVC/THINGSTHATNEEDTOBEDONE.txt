2. (Brett - I need some help with this...) Sorting packages by various categories.

4. (brendan) CSS and styling

5. (Brett - complete, replaced content of TRAVELEXPERTSDB!!README!! with the full SQL script, maybe we should package it as a .SQL file somehow?) Fix TRAVELEXPERTSDB!!README!! so that it is just one sql. Should be really easy just need to use the old travel experts
sql and modify it a bit.
