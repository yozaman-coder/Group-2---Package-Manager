IF YOU WANT TO DO ONE OF THE TASKS WRITE YOUR NAME OVER IT SO THAT WE DON'T WORK ON THE SAME THING ELL O ELL
YOU CAN ALWAYS ADD TO THIS AS WELL IF I FORGET SOME STUFF

1. Validate user registration data

2. (Brett - I can take a shot at this) Have a page that lists all packages with an ability to choose the sorting method and then sort packages by that method.
* We could just have one sorting method although I wrote a bit of code already to make this work in PackageManager and 
the PackagesSorting view component.

3. Allow user to book one of the packages and create a new booking for them.

4. CSS and styling

5. Fix TRAVELEXPERTSDB!!README!! so that it is just one sql. Should be really easy just need to use the old travel experts
sql and modify it a bit.
